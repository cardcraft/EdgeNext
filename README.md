# The New EdgeNext Userscript, By a Nerd for Nerds

Recently, Edgenuity has implemented some checks for userscripts. Of course, they could always just make their courses better, but... **NOPE!**
They decided that we should just suffer more.

I'm working on a new userscript that's made to be as undetectable as possible. At the moment, there isn't much going on with it, but I plan to add some
more features that other similar projects had.

At the moment, it can automatically go to the next slide when the current one is finished and allows you to click while the intro is still rolling.

Also, for anyone here expecting some magical auto-answering or cheating plugin, this isn't it. All this plugin has are qol improvments to makes things go by smoother

### Notices:

#### Auto Advance broken.

edgenuity implemented detection for autoadvance. currently I just disabled it, will fix soon :)

#### Huzzah!! A new update

First time since break, its a decent update. added auto advance for EdgeEX.

Still working on normal auto advance for normal edge, they made it hard ðŸ˜•

#### Doesn't work on Chrome/Edge

Chrome implements restrictions for security that I cannot bypass. use chromium or firefox

Firefox is better because I develop it on there

### Installation

##### Violent Monkey

Open the ViolentMonkey dashboard.
Click the "+" button.
Copy the EdgeNext.js file contents from this repo and paste them into there.
Finally, save.

It should be the same thing for every other manager ever made, but the script is tested with Violent Monkey on Firefox.

### Why Isn't It on Greasy Fork?

Well, I tried, but no matter what I did, the site would just say I can't publish with a disposable email. I'm using a Gmail account, by the way.
